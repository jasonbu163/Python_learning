# Python之禅

简单即美，大道至简

| Beautiful is better than ugly.                               | 漂亮的比丑陋的好                   |
| Explicit is better than implicit.                            | 青涩的比晦涩的好                   |
| Simple is better than complex.                               | 简单的比复杂的好                   |
| Complex is better than complicated.                          | 复杂的比错综复杂的好               |
